# Myporia-2024
 My personal blog theme updated with MODERN CSS for 2024!

Notable changes from old Myporia (though I doubt anyone but myself needs to know)
 - Changed the style sheet from blog.css in the root to style/blog-style.css
 - Mobile first: the CSS assumes 1 column mobile and then uses MQ to create desktop layout
 - Using Flex and MQ, users can actually visit the site on their phones and have a decent time of it
 - DARK THEME! For cave lords and tired people
